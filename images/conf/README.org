* images/conf/
  This directory will be exploded into =~= for every image spun up as part of the mobile-suit. You might want to include:
  
  - =.ssh/=
  - =.gitconfig=

** Keys
   =*.gpg= files are decrypted using GnuPG before being propagated to images, so you don't need to worry about accidentally committing private keys. Just make sure you GnuPG encrypt them!
